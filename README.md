## Prerequisites

1. Please create an account on [Tenderly](https://dashboard.tenderly.co/), then build a project

4. Similarly, create a Slack webhook at [https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook) and store its URL in the `SLACK_PAYMASTER_CHANNEL_WEBHOOK` variable within Tenderly Web3 Secrets.

5. Add a storage entry "MONITORED_PAYMASTER_ADDRESSES" as a string array, e.g., `["0x44D6f8362c144A1217f24A11bE35f2c418B6cb20","0xBDd6EB5C9A89f21B559f65C6b2bbeC265cE54C82","0x4779C973b060c9cc1592b404cAd9CB5AFB0d4B52"]`.
